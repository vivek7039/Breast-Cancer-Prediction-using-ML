# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
In this project we are predicting the probability of having breast cancer on the basis of various parameters that are used to detect Breast Cancer.
We are training and testing three different machine learning models namely logistic regression, decision tree and random forest and comparing 
which of these models provides the highest accuracy We are using a data file from kaggle for the training and testing purpose.
